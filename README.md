About M.N.C.
Music notes and chords what is this all about?

Many people know that if you have a major diatonic scale,
it's going to be made of certain chords major and minor
Oh yeah there's some kind of diminished chord in there.
But what if you just randomly selected notes?
What kind of chord relationships do those notes have with chords
that's what we're going to explore.

 I found that I can add razor components then add a class file of the same name (Logic.razor.cs) 
 I could use that as a plain class file then i just don't use the view portion (Logic.razor) 
 That way I can create many files each handling its own decision function
 
 What I think I understand can often be wrong. I do find that for some reason both in Java and C# counting 
 an array back to zero doesn't work. So I have to make a special case.
